# ExtractKeyMaster

Exploit that extracts Qualcomm's KeyMaster keys using CVE-2015-6639 and CVE-2016-2431

## Instructions

1. `.\build`
2. Use ADB to copy over the executable to the device, maybe /data/tmp or the SD card.
3. Use ADB shell to run it. You probably want to run it as root.
4. Hope for the best.

If anything fails then you'll need to figure out what's wrong.

## Help

No. This is not a project I plan to uphold. It's just an archive of what I've previously done to dump shit.
