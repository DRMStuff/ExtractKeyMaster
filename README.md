# ExtractKeyMaster

Exploit that extracts Qualcomm's KeyMaster keys using CVE-2015-6639 and CVE-2016-2431

## Instructions

1. `.\build`
2. Use ADB to copy over the executable to the device, maybe /data/tmp or the SD card.
3. Use ADB shell to run it. You probably want to run it as root, and you may need to chmod it for execution and r/w perms.
4. Hope for the best.

You could also just use `.\execute` or look at it as an example. If anything fails then you'll need to figure out what's wrong.

## Help

No. This is not a project I plan to uphold. It's just an archive of what I've previously done to dump shit.
